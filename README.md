## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to sharing and collaborating on 3D printing projects. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced maker, you will find a variety of projects to explore and build. The projects range from simple household items to complex mechanical parts, all designed to be printed on standard 3D printers.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Archi LEGO**: A prototype of custom LEGO pieces for a serious game about data management.

Each project folder contains:

- **README.md**: Detailed instructions and information about the project.
- **STL Files or 3MF Projects**: The 3D model files needed for printing, or entire 3MF projects.
- **Source Files**: Original design files (if available) for further customization.
- **Images**: Photos or renders of the finished project.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the instructions in the respective project's README file. Generally, you will need a 3D printer and slicing software to convert the STL files into printable G-code.

## Requirements

- 3D Printer: Any standard FDM printer.
- Slicing Software: Software like PrusaSlicer, or OrcaSlicer.
- Filament: Suitable filament for your printer (generally PLA).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Njko/3d-prints.git

## Usage

- Open the STL files in your preferred slicing software.
- Adjust the print settings according to your printer and filament specifications.
- Slice the model to generate the G-code.
- Transfer the G-code to your 3D printer and start printing.
